# One Billion Brackets

Generate as many NCAA brackets as possible

## Premise

Filling out an NCAA bracket involves making 63 binary decisions, meaning there are 2<sup>63</sup> possible entries. That comes out to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, or "nine quintillion." This program will surely die before we get there, but it can spit out a million possible brackets in a few minutes.

## Usage

	npm install
	node bracket.js
